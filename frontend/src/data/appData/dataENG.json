After cutting the pieces, I followed the assembly steps to glue them together and also reused some components from my previous plane. <br />Before flying it, I balanced the plane and configured its components. <br />Initial flights: the engine wasn't powerful enough for the plane's size, and the balance could be improved. However, the plane was more robust and easier to control than the first model. <br />For the next steps, I installed a more powerful engine, but it didn't significantly improve flight performance. It eventually broke due to multiple crashes. <br />For the next model, I'm planning to build a glider to focus on construction and flying without the motor constraint.",
